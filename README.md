# Perl-project

P1.
First, I created two item a and b, and a union array to have all the items in a and b together, and then convert it to a hash and apply keys method on it, and then convert it back to array again. 
Then I can see if the array is scalar or list, and return the value accordingly.

P2.
First, read the file.
And then, writing the regular expression.
1.	skip if the line is in either single quote or double quote.
2.	Delete comment if itâ€™s in /* */.
3.	Delete comment if it starts with //.
To run the program, simple run perl p2.pl file.c
(file.c in the folder is a testing file.)
